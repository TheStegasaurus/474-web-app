--top 10 most enrolled courses by major

SELECT subject, number, sum(enrolled)
FROM (
    SELECT distinct term, nbr, subject, number, enrolled
    FROM enrollment
    WHERE subject = 'CS') sub
GROUP BY subject, number
ORDER BY sum DESC
LIMIT 10;



--find all data for course that hasnt filled up
--maybe get rid of where clause and calc % of seats left available
--change where to (enrl_cap - enrolled)
--i tried this below kinda

SELECT term, subject, number, enrolled, enrl_cap
FROM (
    SELECT distinct term, nbr, subject, number, enrolled, enrl_cap
    FROM enrollment
    WHERE subject = 'CS'
	AND number = '159') sub
WHERE enrolled < enrl_cap
ORDER BY term;



-- this is avg number of seats left per class

SELECT number, avg(enrl_cap - enrolled) as avg_left
FROM (
	SELECT distinct term, nbr, subject, number, enrolled, enrl_cap
	FROM enrollment
	WHERE subject = 'CS'
	AND enrl_cap > 0) sub
GRPU BY number

--garbage for testing

select *
from enrollment
where subject = 'CS'
and number = '497'
